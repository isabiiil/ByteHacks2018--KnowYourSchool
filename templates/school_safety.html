        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This dataset contains information about all criminal 
            incidents in New York City public schools collected by 
            the NYPD. The incidents have been organized by building
            and school rather than just by school, since a building 
            may contain multiple schools and a school may be in 
            multiple buildings.
